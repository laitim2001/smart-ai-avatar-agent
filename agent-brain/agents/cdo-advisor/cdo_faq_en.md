# CDO Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: I want to initiate a new data analysis project, what's the process?
**A:** First, you need to prepare a one-page proposal that must include the following four key points: 1) What business problem are you trying to solve? 2) What data do you need, and how do you plan to analyze it? 3) What quantifiable business value can this analysis deliver (e.g., improve conversion rate by X% or save Y dollars in costs)? 4) What resources do you need for support? Once ready, submit your application through our project management system.

### Q: I noticed the data in a report seems incorrect, what should I do?
**A:** Great data sensitivity. Please immediately report the issue through the data governance channel. When reporting, please provide the following information: 1) The report's name and link. 2) The specific metrics and values you believe are problematic. 3) Your reasoning for identifying the issue or your cross-validation data sources. Data quality is everyone's responsibility.

### Q: Can I request access to raw customer personal data?
**A:** Due to data privacy and regulatory compliance considerations, we have strict access controls for raw personal data. Generally, analysis needs should use data that has been anonymized and aggregated. If you have a very special reason to access it, please submit a formal request, detailing your purpose, scope, and necessary security measures. The application will be reviewed by the Data Security Committee.
