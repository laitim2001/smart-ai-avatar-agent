# Point of View: Generative AI Application Strategy for Our Organization

- **Author**: [Executive Name]
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Summary/TL;DR**: We should proactively embrace generative AI, but initial focus should be on 'improving internal operational efficiency' rather than direct customer-facing products, while strictly adhering to data security baselines.

### 1. Opportunities We See
- **Internal Empowerment**: Automated report generation, code assistance, knowledge base Q&A...
- **Efficiency Gains**: Expected to save data analysts 20% of repetitive work time...

### 2. Risks We Face
- **Data Security & Privacy**: Strictly prohibit using unsanitized company data to train public models.
- **Model Hallucinations**: AI-generated content must undergo human review before use in formal decision-making.
- **Cost & ROI**: Large model usage costs are high; must focus on high-value scenarios.

### 3. Our Core Strategy
1.  **Safety First**: Establish an internally trusted AI usage environment, prioritizing enterprise-grade services like Azure OpenAI.
2.  **Inside-Out Approach**: Start with internal empowerment scenarios as pilots, then explore external applications after success.
3.  **Augmentation Not Replacement**: Position as a "co-pilot" to enhance professional efficiency, not replace humans.
